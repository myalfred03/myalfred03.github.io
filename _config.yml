          Electrocardiograph capable of recording and transmitting data, using the Bluetooth communication protocol, to a computer. Microcontroller technology was used to implement the electrocardiograph and LABVIEW to develop the program to receive and process data in order to show the electrocardiogram in the computer screen. Data are stored in an EEPROM memory for further analysis. <mark>2nd place project automation category.</mark> in <mark>TECNO – UNI</mark>

        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          The laboratory was developed with the Robotic Operating System (ROS) as its fundamental element, which has become a de facto standard for professionals dedicated to the development of robotic systems. ROS has many software tools and simulators that allow the analysis of a robotic application, whether it is real or simulated. <mark>1st place Best international project.</mark> in <mark>Second Technological Week Honduras</mark>

      I enjoy reading books with futuristic concepts and classic science fiction. I like to learn about astronomy every day, currently I have my own telescope. The concept that we are: *"Speck of dust suspended in a ray of sunlight"* teaches me humility.
